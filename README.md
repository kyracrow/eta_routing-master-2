Copy to desktop. Open in Webstorm. Run NPM INSTALL in the command line.

I added Angular via npm install angular --save. I copied two angular files and moved them to the vendor folder. I removed the JQuery script tag and added Angular tags as well as modified their routes. I was unable to hook up angular in index.html correctly. I believe it is because of the angular files I copied from node_modules.
